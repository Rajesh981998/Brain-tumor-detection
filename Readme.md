In this project we extracted the brain boundaries from the resting state functional magnetic resonance 
imaging (rs-fMRI) scans of different patients data which serves as training data and after extracting we have classified IC images of resting state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI) scans as Noise and Resting state network (RSN) using supervised learning techinques. we have implemented transfer learning techniques to a VGG16-based machine learning modelwhich resulted in a 97% accurate identification of brain tumors in fMRI scan 3D image dataset.
